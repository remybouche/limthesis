# limthesis 

This repository is done to keep track of my thesis. Each chapter is organized in a different file named as 'chapter<No>' where <No> is the number of the chapter. The figures folder is where all figures of the document are stored until I find a better way to organize the figures (by chapter, maybe?).

The paper folder is intended to store all papers related do the thesis in a way that I'ts possible to compile each paper without need to compile the full thesis document.

For compile full thesis document (with bibliography) just run "make thesis".

The .bib file is generated with mendeley software
