abstract = {In this paper, a fully integrated CMOS receiver frontend for high-speed short range wireless applications centering at 60GHz millimeter wave (mmW) band is designed and implemented in 90nm CMOS technology. The 60GHz receiver is designed based on the super-heterodyne architecture consisting of a low noise amplifier (LNA) with inter-stage peaking technique, a single-balanced RF mixer, an IF amplifier, and a double-balanced I/Q down-conversion IF mixer. The proposed 60GHz receiver frontend derives from the sliding-IF structure and is designed with 7GHz ultra-wide bandwidth around 60GHz, supporting four 2.16GHz receiving channels from IEEE 802.11ad standard for next generation high speed Wi-Fi applications. Measured results show that the entire receiver achieves a peak gain of 12dB and an input 1-dB compression point of -14.5dBm, with a noise figure of lower than 7dB, while consumes a total DC current of only 60mA from a 1.2V voltage supply. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, the standard 0.18 {\&}{\#}x03BC;m CMOS technology is employed to design two compact 60 GHz bandpass filters using complementary-conducting strip transmission lines (CCS-TLs). The CCS-TL is a kind of synthetic quasi-TEM transmission line. For the integrated circuit process, this guided-wave structure not only automatically satisfies the requirement of the metal density design rules, but also provides the slow-wave effect to miniaturize circuit size. By applying CCS-TLs, two dual-mode ring filters, denoted as type-I and type-I filters, are developed with two-types of perturbation structures, namely step-impedance sections and shunt open stubs. The inserted perturbation structures are mainly utilized to produce a pair of transmission zeros for improving the passband selectivity. The core sizes of type-I and type-II filters are 360 {\&}{\#}x03BC;m {\&}{\#}x00D7; 210 {\&}{\#}x03BC;m and 330 {\&}{\#}x03BC;m {\&}{\#}x00D7; 240 {\&}{\#}x03BC;m, respectively. The type-I filter has a 3.86 dB insertion loss and a 36{\%} 3-dB bandwidth at the center frequency 65.25 GHz, while the type-II filter has a 4.8 dB insertion loss and a 28.3{\%} 3-dB bandwidth at the center frequency 63.5 GHz.

The noise and input-impedance matched LNA employs a cascode input stage with shunt-series, transformer feedback. A theoretical and experimental comparison with a conventional inductor-feedback LNA indicates 0.5-1 dB higher gain, 0.3-0.6 dB lower noise figure and better input return loss for the transformer feedback LNA.

The circuit occupies an area of 460 mum times 500 mum and consumes 89 mW (47 mW in the LNA and mixer) from a 1.5 V supply.

abstract = {This tutorial presents an overview of the technological advances in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) circuit components, antennas, and propagation that will soon allow 60-GHz transceivers to provide multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) wireless communication data transfers in the consumer marketplace. Our goal is to help engineers understand the convergence of communications, circuits, and antennas, as the emerging world of subterahertz and terahertz wireless communications will require understanding at the intersections of these areas. This paper covers trends and recent accomplishments in a wide range of circuits and systems topics that must be understood to create massively broadband wireless communication systems of the future. In this paper, we present some evolving applications of massively broadband wireless communications, and use tables and graphs to show research progress from the literature on various radio system components, including on-chip and in-package antennas, radio-frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs), low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), mixers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We focus primarily on silicon-based technologies, as these provide the best means of implementing very low-cost, highly integrated 60-GHz mm-wave circuits. In addition, the paper illuminates characterization techniques that are required to competently design and fabricate mm-wave devices in silicon, and illustrates effects of the 60-GHz RF propagation channel for both in-building and outdoor use. The paper concludes with an overview of the standardization and commercialization efforts for 60-GHz multi-Gb/s devices, and presents a novel way to compare the data rate versus power efficiency for future broadband devices.},

abstract = {Prior work indicates that various aspects of task-irrelevant information (e.g. its salience, task-relatedness, emotionality) can increase the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in top-down attentional control. In light of these findings, we hypothesize that PFC's involvement increases when task-irrelevant information competes for priority in processing. In an event-related fMRI study using an oddball variant of the Stroop task, we examine the generality of this hypothesis using three manipulations designed to increase the ability of task-irrelevant information to compete for priority in processing. First, we investigated how the frequency of occurrence of task-irrelevant information affects PFC activity. Second, we examined whether conflicting color information (i.e. incongruent trials) increases activity in regions of PFC that are similar to or distinct from those sensitive to infrequently occurring task-irrelevant information. Finally, we examined the impact of the number of levels at which conflict could occur (e.g. non-response only, non-response and response). Activity in posteriorâdorsolateral and posteriorâinferior PFC increased for infrequently occurring task-irrelevant information, being largest when the task-irrelevant information contained conflicting color-information. In contrast, increases in mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex's activity were only noted when conflicting color information was present, being largest when conflict occurred at multiple levels. The anterior cingulate was primarily sensitive to the occurrence of conflict at the response level with only a small sub-region exhibiting sensitivity to non-response conflict as well. From these findings we suggest that posterior DLPFC and PIPFC are involved in biasing processing in posterior processing systems, mid-DLPFC is involved in biasing the processing of the contents of working memory, and ACC is primarily involved in response-related processes.},

The design method helps achieve not only efficient size reduction but also two controllable transmission zeros located on both sides of the passband. One transmission zero is produced by a coupled line structure, whereas the other one is produced owing to the appearance of a parasitic inductor. Therefore, the proposed BPF can obtain a better cutoff rate in the edges of the passband and provide much improved skirt selectivity. The entire chip size of the proposed filter is 0.182 Ã 0.566 mm2, and the core size is 0.062 Ã 0.556 mm2. The proposed filter with a center frequency of 60 GHz has an insertion loss of less than 3.5-dB. A good agreement between the simulation and measurement results is observed.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimized very high performance CMOS slow-wave shielded CPW transmission lines (S-CPW TLines). They are used to realize a 60-GHz bandpass filter, with T-junctions and open stubs. Owing to a strong slow-wave effect, the longitudinal length of the S-CPW is reduced by a factor up to 2.6 compared to a classical microstrip topology in the same technology. Moreover, the quality factor of the realized S-CPWs reaches 43 at 60 GHz, which is about two times higher than the microstrip one and corresponds to the state of the art concerning S-CPW TLines with moderate width. For a proof of concept of complex passive device realization, two millimeter-wave filters working at 60 GHz based on dual-behavior-resonator filters have been designed with these S-CPWs and measured up to 110 GHz. The measured insertion loss for the first-order (respectively, second-order) filter is -2.6 dB (respectively, -4.1 dB). The comparison with a classical microstrip topology and the state-of-the-art CMOS filter results highlights the very good performance of the realized filters in terms of unloaded quality factor. It also shows the potential of S-CPW TLines for the design of high-performance complex CMOS passive devices.},

At 61.5 GHz, the two-stage LNA achieves 4.5-dB NF, 15-dB gain, consuming 6 mA from 1.8 V. This is the first known demonstration of a silicon LNA at V-band. The downconverter consists of a preamplifier, I/Q double-balanced mixers, a frequency tripler, and a quadrature generator, and is again the first known demonstration of silicon active mixers at V-band. At 60 GHz, the downconverter gain is 18.6 dB and the NF is 13.3 dB, and the circuit consumes 55 mA from 2.7 V, while the output buffers consume an additional 52 mA. The balanced class-AB PA provides 10.8-dB gain, +11.2-dBm 1-dB compression point, 4.3{\%} maximum PAE, and 16-dBm saturated output power. Finally, fully differential Colpitts VCOs have been implemented at 22 and 67 GHz.

The METIS overall approach toward 5G builds on the evolution of existing technologies complemented by new radio concepts that are designed to meet the new and challenging requirements of use cases today's radio access networks cannot support. The integration of these new radio concepts, such as massive MIMO, ultra dense networks, moving networks, and device-to-device, ultra reliable, and massive machine communications, will allow 5G to support the expected increase in mobile data volume while broadening the range of application domains that mobile communications can support beyond 2020. In this article, we describe the scenarios identified for the purpose of driving the 5G research direction. Furthermore, we give initial directions for the technology components (e.g., link level components, multinode/multiantenna, multi-RAT, and multi-layer networks and spectrum handling) that will allow the fulfillment of the requirements of the identified 5G scenarios.},

abstract = {With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, the fifth generation (5G) mobile network would exploit the enormous amount of spectrum in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to greatly increase communication capacity. There are fundamental differences between mmWave communications and existing other communication systems, in terms of high propagation loss, directivity, and sensitivity to blockage. These characteristics of mmWave communications pose several challenges to fully exploit the potential of mmWave communications, including integrated circuits and system design, interference management, spatial reuse, anti-blockage, and dynamics control. To address these challenges, we carry out a survey of existing solutions and standards, and propose design guidelines in architectures and protocols for mmWave communications. We also discuss the potential applications of mmWave communications in the 5G network, including the small cell access, the cellular access, and the wireless backhaul. Finally, we discuss relevant open research issues including the new physical layer technology, software-defined network architecture, measurements of network state information, efficient control mechanisms, and heterogeneous networking, which should be further investigated to facilitate the deployment of mmWave communication systems in the future 5G networks.},

A comprehensive survey of the suggested parameter-extraction methodology for the SiGe HBT transistor model in conjunction with the analytically derived equations is given. The suggested transistor model is compatible with BiCMOS processes and takes into account the parasitic effects like the extrinsic capacitances and substrate effect. The accuracy of the proposed transistor model is verified by on-wafer S-parameter measurements up to 40 GHz. An important proof of the accuracy of the proposed parameter-extraction methodology is the presented physical noise model that can accurately predict the measured noise parameters up to our measurement frequency limit of 18 GHz. The noise model accuracy at various temperatures and biases is examined. Finally, the effect of the on-wafer contact pads on the noise performance of the transistor is investigated in detail.},

abstract = {â This paper proposes a transformer-based broad-band low-noise amplifier (LNA) for millimeter-wave application. The proposed LNA has four common-source stages. Three transformers are used to connect the drains of the former transistors and the sources of the following transistors to boost the transconductances of the following transistors. Thus, the gain of the circuit is effectively increased. In addition, the noise figure (NF) is decreased because the noise contributions of the following stages are further suppressed by the application of the transformers. To enhance the gain bandwidth, the gate inductor in each inter-stage matching network is indepen-dently adjusted to separate the main poles of the four stages. The LNA is demonstrated using a commercial 65-nm CMOS process. According to the measurement results, a maximum gain of 17.7 GHz at 67 GHz and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 35.6 GHz are achieved. The measured NF is 5.4â7.4 dB at 54â67 GHz. The tested input 1-dB gain compression point (IP 1 dB) ranges from â15.4 to â11.7 dBm in the entire 3-dB gain bandwidth. With 1-V power supply, the LNA consumes 19-mA dc current. The chip size is only 0.37 mm 2 with all pads.

What gaps in wireless technology exist even today? Perhaps the most obvious missing link is between the various devices that we carry with us, such as cellular phones or personal digital assistants (or smart phones if you prefer), digital cameras, music and video players (such as the ubiquitous iPod), laptops, and peripherals such as external hard drives and monitors. The case of the mobile smart phone is particularly important since the existing wireless connectivity is either too slow and power hungry (Bluetooth) or designed and optimized for longer ranges (WiFi). What is missing is a wireless universal connectivity that can support high data rates demanded by large data rate multimedia applications. Wireless technology has been conspicuously absent from MP3 music players (such as Apple's iPod), which are ideal candidates for downloading music and video. While ultrawideband (UWB) technology using the 3-0 GHz band promised to fulfill these needs, it fell short in many ways, and, today, most of the start-up companies pursuing UWB have folded.},
annote = {During the introductory section the author compare the new use of 60GHz band (ISM) with the UWB band, where this last was intended to transmit high data-rates for mobile applications in a near past. Due to authors comparisions it seems that the 60GHz band usage is promissor for high data-rates usage and that can transform the long term structure of LANs and its applications.

Also, it is interesting how the authors talks about the possible applications as a motivation to 60GHz researches. There is a world of possibilities such as device connections -- eliminating connexion cables --, wireless USB-like connection -- connecting a storage device virtualy in every 'ready-to-connect' device, such as USB nowadays --, streaming services that could benefit from the data transmission rate, using the ability to transmit uncompressed data, eliminating the computational bottleneck in decompression.},

We propose a novel two-stage common source cascode LNA and study its gain switching properties via back gate tuning in 32 nm DG-MOSFETs that leads to variable and reconfigurable device performances not found in comparable amplifiers built with conventional CMOS architectures without additional hardware. The peak gain changes by almost 9 dB from 6 dB to 14.9 dB for back gate biases of 0.3 V and 0.7 V respectively. The 3-dB bandwidth ranges from 60 - 75 GHz. The noise figure of the LNA varies from 6.8 dB at 0.7 V to 12 dB at 0.3 V. The maximum dissipated power is 12 mW for 1.2 V supply. The minimum 3rd order input intercept point is found to be - 5.1 dBm. These performance parameters are either comparable or better to some of the recent LNA designs in ? 60 GHz frequency at different technologies compared in this text. Finally, we briefly illustrate the application of this DG-MOSFET gain tuning LNA for a Wireless Network on Chip architecture. ? 2013 IEEE.},

In this letter, we investigate the problem of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in mil-limeter wave (mmWave)-enabled massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. The problem is cast as a network utility maximization subject to probabilistic latency and reliability constraints. To solve this problem, we resort to the Lyapunov tech-nique whereby a utility-delay control approach is proposed, which adapts to channel variations and queue dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed approach ensures reliable communication with a guaranteed probability of 99.99{\%}, and reduces latency by 28.41{\%} and 77.11{\%} as compared to baselines with and without probabilistic latency constraints, respectively.

The CMOS bandpass filter is mainly composed of an open resonator loaded with two grounded pedestal stepped-impedance stubs to enhance the band selectivity and reduce the chip size. The grounded pedestal is constructed from the vertical stack of the multiple metal layers of the CMOS structure such that the slow-wave effect is present when inserting it beneath the microstrip signal trace. Hence the effective guided-wavelength is shortened. By using this technique, a bandpass filter at 77 GHz was designed. The chip size is as small as 0.31Ã0.26 mm2, the measured insertion loss is 3.9 dB and the return loss is better than 20 dB in 75 to 84 GHz. Two transmission zeros at 61 GHz and 109 GHz dramatically enhance the band selectivity.},

@article{Karacaoglu1993,
abstract = {A novel bandpass filter design is presented which uses a dual-mode microstrip ring resonator with a pair of FETs which provide negative resistance to compensate for the losses in the ring. The measured results show excellent performance, with a 32-MHz, 3-dB bandwidth centered at 1.48 GHz. The technique used is particularly attractive because of its ability to implement two transmission poles and two transmission zeros with only one ring if a suitable mode-coupling structure is designed. The advantage of the combined passive resonator and active device technique is that the poles and zeros of the filter are accurately defined by the ring dimensions, and the FETs only provide negative resistance to compensate for the ring losses. Hence, the filter is less sensitive to environmental changes than a filter based on entirely active techniques.},

abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate a miniature low-insertion-loss 60-GHz-band bandpass filter by standard 0.13 $\mu$m CMOS technology. Low-insertion-loss is achieved by adopting thick microstrip-line (MSL) with optimized ground-plane pattern as the needed inductors to minimize the metal and substrate loss. This filter achieved insertion-loss (1/S21) lower than 3 dB over the frequency range of 56.9â68.6 GHz, input return loss (S11) better than â10 dB over the frequency range of 53.4â71.9 GHz, and output return loss (S22) better than â10 dB over the frequency range of 53.2â70.9 GHz. The minimum insertion-loss was 2.55 dB at 62.5 GHz. To the authors' knowledge, this is the best result ever reported for a 60-GHz-band CMOS bandpass filter in the literature.

abstract = {The vision of next generation 5G wireless communications lies in providing very high data rates (typically of Gbps order), extremely low latency, manifold increase in base station capacity and significant improvement in users' perceived Quality of Service (QoS), compared to current 4G LTE networks. Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this paper, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution towards 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the Radio Access Network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes, needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future resea- ch directions.},

This paper describes the second generation of single-chip TX and RX MMICs developed in our group. Compared to our first designs in a commercial pHEMT technology, the MMICs presented in this paper show the same high level of integration but occupy smaller chip area and have higher gain and output power at only half of the DC power consumption. The system operates with an LO signal in the range 7-8 GHz. This LO signal is multiplied in an integrated multiply-by-eight (times8) LO chain, resulting in an IF center frequency of 2.5 GHz. The single chip TX MMIC consists of a balanced resistive mixer with an integrated ultra wideband IF balun, a three-stage amplifier and the times8 LO chain. The times8 is a multifunction design by itself consisting of a quadrupler, a feed back amplifier, a doubler, and a buffer amplifier. The TX chip delivers 4.1 plusmn 1.5 dBm over an RF frequency range of 56.5 to 64.5 GHz. The peak output power is 5.6 dBm measured at 60 GHz and the overall TX chip consumes 420 mW of DC power. The single chip RX MMIC contains a three-stage low noise amplifier, an image reject mixer with an integrated ultra wideband IF hybrid and the same times8 as used in the TX chip. The RX chip has more than 10.7 dB gain between 54.5 and 64.5 GHz and more than 13 dB of image rejection ratio between 57.5 and 67.5 GHz with a peak image rejection ratio of 22.5 dB at 64 GHz. The input referred third order intercept point, IIP3 is measured to -10 dBm at 60 GHz and the overall RX chip consumes 450 mW of DC power},

abstract = {There is considerable pressure to define the key requirements of 5G, develop 5G standards, and perform technology trials as quickly as possible. Normally, these activities are best done in series but there is a desire to complete these tasks in parallel so that commercial deployments of 5G can begin by 2020. 5G will not be an incremental improvement over its predecessors; it aims to be a revolutionary leap forward in terms of data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. These capabilities are targeted at realizing high-speed connectivity, the Internet of Things, augmented virtual reality, the tactile internet, and so on. The requirements of 5G are expected to be met by new spectrum in the microwave bands (3.3-4.2 GHz), and utilizing large bandwidths available in mm-wave bands, increasing spatial degrees of freedom via large antenna arrays and 3-D MIMO, network densification, and new waveforms that provide scalability and flexibility to meet the varying demands of 5G services. Unlike the one size fits all 4G core networks, the 5G core network must be flexible and adaptable and is expected to simultaneously provide optimized support for the diverse 5G use case categories. In this paper, we provide an overview of 5G research, standardization trials, and deployment challenges. Due to the enormous scope of 5G systems, it is necessary to provide some direction in a tutorial article, and in this overview, the focus is largely user centric, rather than device centric. In addition to surveying the state of play in the area, we identify leading technologies, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, and outline the key challenges ahead, with research test beds delivering promising performance but pre-commercial trials lagging behind the desired 5G targets.},
